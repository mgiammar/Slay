# Slay

This library aims to replecate the 1995 game *Slay* by Sean O'Connor using Python.
The library uses Pygame to render the game and receive users inputs. 
Computation and game logic is done in the background using Python (potentially also C in the future),

A detailed description of the games rules can be found [here][1] and entertaining videos of *Slay* can easilt be found on the internet

My goal with this library is to practice object oriented Python and experiment with algorithms for computer players.
